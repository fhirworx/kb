DIY keyboard project

The repository files are all WIP. These all were drafted using OnShape. Source files available [here](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/b978ef6154e055ffa927ee69/w/87cb33563c0c307d1572ec2f/e/93ba612c50cada87610d1285?renderMode=0&uiState=626d574906a40d3bbee700cf).

Nothing here is "production ready." Use, repurpose, and iterate as you wish. This is and always will be a hobby project and fully open source.
